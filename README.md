# CipherCLI - A Command Line Cipher Tool

CipherCLI is a Python-based command-line tool that implements various classical encryption and decryption ciphers. You can use this tool to encrypt and decrypt messages using ciphers such as Additive Cipher, Multiplicative Cipher, Vigenère Cipher, Playfair Cipher, and more.

## Ciphers Implemented
1. **Additive Cipher**
2. **Multiplicative Cipher**
3. **Affine Cipher**
4. **Monoalphabetic Substitution Cipher**
5. **Autokey Cipher**
6. **Vigenère Cipher**
7. **Playfair Cipher**
8. **Keyless Transposition Cipher**
9. **Keyed Transposition Cipher**
10. **Double Transposition Cipher**

## Features
- **Encrypt**: Encrypt any given plaintext with the chosen cipher.
- **Decrypt**: Decrypt any given ciphertext with the chosen cipher.
- **Multiple Cipher Support**: Choose from 10 different cipher techniques.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface to interact with the program.

## Prerequisites
- **Python 3**: Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
- **No external libraries** are required. The project uses standard Python libraries only.

## Installation
1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/aamnamz/ciphertool
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd CipherCLI
   ```
3. Run the program:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage
Once the program is running, you will be presented with a menu to choose the cipher you'd like to use.

### Example:
1. Choose a cipher (e.g., **Additive Cipher**).
2. Choose between **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**.
3. Input your plaintext/ciphertext and the necessary keys.
4. The program will display the encrypted/decrypted text.
